What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the .git folder and allows you to start adding files to be tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It stores changes that are tracked but not yet commited.  It allows edits that implement the same logical change to be grouped.
